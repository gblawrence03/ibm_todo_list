### What is this?

These are my solutions to the todo list lab in the IBM React development course.
I've also made some additional improvements. 
- There's some confusing instances in the code and on the webpage where the word "list" is used instead of "item", such as the button to add an item to the list with the text "Add List" instead of "Add Item". I've changed all of these.
- Added buttons to remove items from lists
- Improved some styling
